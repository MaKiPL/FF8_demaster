For the mod to work you need the latest ____1.0.3.0____ patched Final Fantasy VIII: Remaster game.
It works both on Japanese and EFIGS (English,French,Italian,German,Spanish) versions of the game.
The bare minimum is to have the game patche to 1.0.3.0 version which is the latest version of the game. It's due to the fact, that the addresses that I hook and inject into are different between all versions from 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.3.0 + independent one for Japanese version. The mod is not compatible with any other version of the game. Please also run the game at least once after downloading from Steam.
